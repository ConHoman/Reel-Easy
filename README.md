# What I Learned

I learned that game design is a fun, and often times difficult process. Doing one thing could completely break your game (so always have backups). I've learned to appreciate game designers because this process took a lot of time and work for such a simple game. The most difficult part of the entire project was probably implementing the animations. I got free assets from Itch.io, and it took me about 4 days of working on putting them in the game to finally figure it out. Many times when I got stuck all I had to do was press one button that fixed everything. That happens more than I realized before starting this project, you'll spend hours trying to fix something when its right in front of you. I think the most important thing I learned from this is that patience is important. Without patience and trying things from different angles, I could have never completed this project and made a working game. Time and patience is everything, and being a good problem solver will get you far.
